## üìÉ Rules
Here are the rules of the game : <br>
- The game is basically player versus player game but you can be alone and face a bot.
- Each player has a pile of 20 cards wich they took from the same reserve.
- Each card has a name, an attack, a defense and a magic value.
- Your goal is to reduce the prestige poins of your ennemy and to protect yours.
- Each player sorts his deck according to his strategy, then plays the card on top of his deck each turn. <br>

The winner will be the first to take down the ennemy or the the one who has the most prestige points when one of the two players has no more cards left !

Choose your strategy and your cards wisely knowing that : <br>
- The player having the biggest amount of attack (physical damages) will decrease the prestige of his
  opponent by the difference between his attack value and the defense value of the other player
- If both of the players have the same amount of attack, no harm to any players prestige will be caused
- If the defender has more defense than the attack value of the other player, the defender
  does not gain any prestige points
- The player having the biggest amount of magical power will reduce
  the prestige of his ennemy by the difference of the magical power of value of the two player <br>
